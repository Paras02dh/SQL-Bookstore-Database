# SQL-Bookstore-Database
A good **README** for your project should give a clear overview of the project, explain how to use it, and provide any necessary instructions for setup. Here's an example of what you can include in the **README.md** for your SQL Bookstore Database project:

# SQL Bookstore Database

This project contains a SQL-based dataset for a virtual bookstore. It includes tables for books, authors, publishers, and genres, designed to help you practice SQL queries, data manipulation, and database management.

## Project Overview

The database consists of four main tables:

- **Books**: Contains information about the books, such as title, author, publisher, genre, publication year, and price.
- **Authors**: Stores details about famous authors, such as their name, birth year, and country of origin.
- **Publishers**: Holds details about publishing companies, including name and country.
- **Genres**: Lists different genres of books, such as fiction, drama, adventure, etc.

## Key Features

- Practice **SQL joins** to combine data from different tables (e.g., books and authors).
- Perform **aggregations** and **filtering** operations to analyze data.
- Explore **relationships** between books, authors, publishers, and genres.

## Database Structure

### Tables:
1. **Books** (`book_id`, `title`, `author_id`, `publisher_id`, `genre_id`, `year_published`, `price`)
2. **Authors** (`author_id`, `name`, `birth_year`, `country`)
3. **Publishers** (`publisher_id`, `publisher_name`, `country`)
4. **Genres** (`genre_id`, `genre_name`)

### Sample Data:
The tables contain sample data for several well-known books, authors, and publishers, which makes it ideal for running and testing SQL queries.
