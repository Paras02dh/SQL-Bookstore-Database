# SQL-Bookstore-Database

This project contains a SQL-based dataset for a bookstore. It includes tables for books, authors, publishers, and genres, designed to help you practice SQL queries, data manipulation, and database management.

## Project Overview

The database consists of four main tables:

- **Books**: Contains information about the books, such as title, author, publisher, genre, publication year, and price.
- **Authors**: Stores details about famous authors, such as their name, birth year, and country of origin.
- **Publishers**: Holds details about publishing companies, including name and country.
- **Genres**: Lists different genres of books, such as fiction, drama, adventure, etc.

## Key Features

- Practice **SQL joins** to combine data from different tables (e.g., books and authors).
- Perform **aggregations** and **filtering** operations to analyze data.
- Explore **relationships** between books, authors, publishers, and genres.
